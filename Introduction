Introduction
This project implements a simple Scam IP Detection System using Python. The system checks a list of IP addresses against a database of known scam or malicious IPs. It logs the results, indicating whether each IP is flagged as scam/malicious or is clean. This tool helps investigators and network administrators quickly identify suspicious IP addresses and maintain a record of all checks performed.

Explanation of the Code
Input List of IP Addresses:
The code defines a list of IP addresses (ip_list) that need to be checked for malicious activity.

Scam IP Database:
The system uses a file called scam_ips.txt which contains a list of known scam or malicious IP addresses (one per line).

IP Checking Logic:
For each IP in the input list, the code:

Checks if the IP exists in scam_ips.txt using the is_scam_ip function.
If the IP is found, it prints and logs that the IP is flagged as scam/malicious.
If not found, it prints and logs that the IP is clean.
Logging:
All results are saved in detection.log with a timestamp, providing a historical record of all checks.

Output:

The console displays the status of each IP (scam/malicious or clean).
The log file keeps a detailed record for future reference and investigation.
In summary:
This code automates the process of checking multiple IP addresses against a scam IP database, making it easier to monitor and investigate potential threats in a network.
